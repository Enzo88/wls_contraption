# wls_contraption
Different WebLogic Server Tools

Bunch of tools to help WLS admin, debugging, etc.

1. This first version is a war file to access log files from remote client through an HTML file generated by WLS.
   The core idea is to show the directories/files of a particular server, this way we can debug easily. 
2. JNDI tree printing
3. Oracle JDBC version from MS
